## VALLEY OF BONES

### Chapter 1: Marine (April)

- Basic game mechanics:
    - Move
    - Attack
    - Build
- Multiplayer-only

### Chapter 2: Sniper (May)

- Add a few new units
    - Sniper

- Abilities
    - Sniper has stealth
        - activate with stealth
        - cannot be hit while in stealth, has 0.5x movement
        - cannot fire while in stealth
        - cannot re-enter stealth on the same turn
    - Marine has detection
        - when in range, can shoot stealthed units

- Control points
    - Grant small income/food --> less income/food from base
    - Mechanics:
        - can be captured by moving unit to adjacent space when uncontrolled
        - gains 5 HP per turn per adjacent unit up to 30 HP total (does not increase when 'contested' - enemy unit also adjacent)
        - control resets when "destroyed"
        - spawns "destroyed" (uncontrolled)

### Chapter 3: Mech (December)

+ Central server
    + Keeps a master server list, updates when users start 'public' servers
    + also allow configurable port
    + game reports
- UI Improvements
    + updated look/feel
    - Finish unimplemented features:
        + In game menu (Surrender goes here)
        - Refund
        + Activate/deactivate cloak
        + Zoom
        + Better unit boxes
+ AI
- Android version

- Gameplay changes
    - Attachments for base
        - "Defense platform" --> grants extra attack/damage
        - "Research facility" --> allows upgrades
    - Rewards for kills --> also allows less income from base
    - Saboteur --> heavy infantry (bazooka/missile launcher)
    + Add 2 new mech units
        + light mech
        + artillery
            + splash damage
    + Units built don't grant visibility until end of turn (to prevent 'walking' along the map)
- Basic sounds
- Basic animations

### Later
- Another race
    - set up tension between human/alien races
    - biological race that 'evolves' similarly to zerg?


### BUGS
info panel doesn't update

### ideas

 - saboteur has 'spy' ability - can infiltrate a tower and take without a battle (sacrifice the sabo?)
 - bazooka trooper
 + towers farther apart
 + get cloak working
 - get refund working
 - slow regen?
