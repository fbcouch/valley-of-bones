    - Move
    - Attack
    - Build
- Multiplayer-only

### Chapter 2: Sniper (May)

- Add a few new units
    + Sniper
    - Artillery?
- Attachments for base
    - "Defense platform" --> grants extra attack/damage
    - "Research facility" --> allows upgrades
+ Control points
    - Grant small income/food --> less income/food from base
    - Mechanics:
        - can be captured by moving unit to adjacent space when uncontrolled
        - gains 5 HP per turn per adjacent unit up to 30 HP total (does not increase when 'contested' - enemy unit also adjacent)
        - grants $25/turn and 5 food
        - control resets when "destroyed"
        - spawns "destroyed" (uncontrolled)
        - 30HP, 5 dmg, 1 attack/turn, 3 range?
- Rewards for kills --> also allows less income from base
- Basic sounds
- Package system, move game assets to local rather than internal to jar
    + game assets now local
    - packaging system

    - biological race that 'evolves' similarly to zerg?
