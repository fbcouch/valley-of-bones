### Chapter 2: Sniper (May)

    - Mechanics:
        - can be captured by moving unit to adjacent space when uncontrolled
        - gains 5 HP per turn per adjacent unit up to 30 HP total (does not increase when 'contested' - enemy unit also adjacent)
        - control resets when "destroyed"
        - spawns "destroyed" (uncontrolled)

    - game reports
- Gameplay changes
    - Attachments for base
        - "Defense platform" --> grants extra attack/damage
        - "Research facility" --> allows upgrades

    - Saboteur --> heavy infantry (bazooka/missile launcher)
    - Add 2 new mech units
